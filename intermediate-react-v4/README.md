- **Code Splitting**

  - Developers usually split their applications into multiple pages that can be accessed from different URLs. Each of these pages becomes a unique entry point into the application. Code-splitting is the process of splitting the application’s bundle into smaller chunks required by each entry point. The goal is to improve the application's initial load time by only loading the code required to run that page. [Ref](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/code-splitting#:~:text=Developers%20usually%20split,run%20that%20page.)

- **Server Side Rendering**
  - Server-side rendering (SSR), is the ability of an application to contribute by displaying the web-page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. Server-side sends a fully rendered page to the client; the client’s JavaScript bundle takes over and allows the SPA framework to operate [Ref](<https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-server-side-rendering#:~:text=Server%2Dside%20rendering%20(SSR)%2C%20is%20the%20ability%20of%20an%20application%20to%20contribute%20by%20displaying%20the%20web%2Dpage%20on%20the%20server%20instead%20of%20rendering%20it%20in%20the%20browser.%20Server%2Dside%20sends%20a%20fully%20rendered%20page%20to%20the%20client%3B%20the%20client%E2%80%99s%20JavaScript%20bundle%20takes%20over%20and%20allows%20the%20SPA%20framework%20to%20operate>)
