# [Making TypeScript Stick by Mike North](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/typescript-practice/)

## Description

Cross the gap from simply knowing TypeScript basics and how to read TypeScript code to being able to tackle new, challenging TypeScript problems. You'll go through a series of challenges designed to reinforce your knowledge and make the important TypeScript concepts truly "stick" in your mind. Test your knowledge through quizzes, challenges, and even a TypeScript game show!

## Notes

I named the exercises and quizzes based on the chapters on the course website
